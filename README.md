# Waveform Documentation

This is the repo for the Waveform documentation.

## [Waveform User Guide](https://github.com/Tracktion/waveform_manual/wiki/Waveform-User-Guide)
The user guide is stored as a wiki in markdown format so can be contributed to by people with a GitHub account.
We are also updating it over time with newer features, images and video links.
